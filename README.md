# SyrinscapeSoundpad
A simple html sound pad for controlling Syrinscape

Syrinscape is awesome, but the app kind of sucks. So I decided to use the 3rd party integrations feature and create a little sound pad for myself. Soemthing with large colourful buttons that I can click on at a glance or easily tap from an iPad.
